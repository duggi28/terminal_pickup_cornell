   Academic Integrity Statement

   I, Eric Zhong (ejz25) , Jonathan Akar (ja529) , Olivia McGoldrick (omm26) , Rithvik Duggireddy (rd532), have fully reviewed the
   course academic integrity policies.  I have adhered to those policies in
   solving the assignment.

   The policies do permit some limited collaboration among students currently
   enrolled in the course. If I did engage in such collaboration, here is the
   list of other students with whom I collaborated, and a brief summary of that
   collaboration:

   - none
